# DepthSearch
**A tool to Ctrl+F a keyword not just in the current webpage, but in all the links of this page (..and so on recursively).**

Can have applications for those involved in research (scientists, journalists etc). Search through all the citations, mentions and hyperlinks easily.

This is currently a jupyter notebook, but hopefully we can turn it into a browser extension
